# Steam market chrome extension

> Steam market modification for counter strike global offensive. I made this extension for my friend who is addicted to the market :)

Requires at least chrome 40.x 

## Installation

Load it as unpacked extension. (I'm not going to submit it to chrome store)

## What it does

On http://steamcommunity.com/market it will by default show newly listed items, filtered only by cs:go, and only some types of weapons (you can modify those weapons in extension options). It will autorefresh that list every 400ms. (you can modify that in options)

On http://steamcommunity.com/market/search you can search multiple items, if you separate them by commas.
